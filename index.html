                    As the world continues to adapt with better technology driven 
                    applications, students will have access to more practical tools. 
                    By learning these tools early, students will have an easier time 
                    collaborating, learning, and programming. Visual Studio Code is 
                    an application that supports many of the most common programming 
                    languages, all in one application. The caveat to this is the 
                    necessity of a compiler, which must be installed outside of Visual 
                    Studio Code. This process can be confusing, so this tutorial seeks 
                    to accurately explain the steps needed to install Visual Studio 
                    Code itself, the C++ Extension, and a compatible C++ Compiler for 
                    the platform. Through this tutorial, the user will need to have 
                    basic coding knowledge, ability to follow an algorithm, and a lot 
                    of patience. This tutorial intends to solve the issue of the 
                    complicated, and slightly unclear, process to be able to program 
                    in and compile C++ in Visual Studio Code. After these instructions, 
                    the user should be able to successfully install Visual Studio Code, 
                    the C++ Extension, a compatible C++ Compiler, and run a small C++ 
                    program to demonstrate.

                    Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular, lightweight, and 
                    open-source integrated development environment (IDE). In an 
                    article originally written and published on Triplebyte.com, 
                    and since moved to Medium.com, Charlie Treichler found that 16.8 
                    percent of candidates interviewing at Triplebyte used Visual Studio 
                    Code.

                    VS Code is a rising technology in the tech industry, and it's 
                    wide range of capabilities including debugging tools, an integrated 
                    terminal, and version control integration, makes it an attractive 
                    candidate for any coder's IDE. 
                </p>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>
                    The installation of VS Code is as easy as clicking a 
                    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">button</a>. 
                    The link provided goes to the download page for visual studio 
                    code where all you need to do is select the appropriate version 
                    for your computer and then run through the installation pop ups. 
                    You don't need to change any of the default settings for this 
                    tutorial.

                <h2><i class="fas fa-star"></i> Installing C++ Compiler</h2>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    C++ is a compiled language, meaning your program's source code 
                    must be translated into machine code (compiled) before it can be 
                    run on your computer. The C/C++ extension that we will walk you 
                    through installing later on in the tutorial doesn't include a C++ 
                    compiler or debugger, since VS Code as an editor relies on 
                    command-line tools for the development workflow. You need to 
                    install these tools or use the tools already installed on your 
                    computer.
                </p>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <h4>Check Computer for Compiler</h4>
                <p>To check if you already have them installed:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open a new VS Code terminal window.</li>
                    <li>
                        Use the following command to check for the GCC compiler:
                        <pre><code>gcc --version
g++ --version
gdb --version</code></pre>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    If no details are shown when running these command then you 
                    do not have a C++ compiler accessible to VS Code and can 
                    proceed to the next step. 
                </p>
                <h4>Install Compiler</h4>
                <p>
                    In this tutorial, we teach you how to install a MinGW compiler. 
                    Mingw-w64 was created to support the GCC compiler on Windows 
                    systems.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        You can download the latest installer from the MSYS2 page 
                        or use this <a heref="https://www.msys2.org/">direct link to the installer</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Run the installer and follow the steps of the installation wizard. 
                        Note that MSYS2 requires 64 bit Windows 8.1 or newer.
                    </li>   
                    <li>
                        In the wizard, choose your desired Installation Folder. 
                        Record this directory for later. In most cases, the recommended 
                        directory is acceptable. The same applies when you get to setting 
                        the start menu shortcuts step.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When complete, ensure the Run MSYS2 now box is checked and select Finish. 
                        This will open a MSYS2 terminal window for you
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In this terminal, install the MinGW-w64 toolchain by running the 
                        following command:
                        <pre><code>pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Accept the default number of packages in the toolchain group by pressing Enter
                    </li>
                    <img src="mingw_screenshot.png" alt="mingw screenshot">
                    <li>
                        Enter Y when prompted whether to proceed with the installation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the path of your MinGW-w64 bin folder to the Windows PATH 
                        environment variable by using the following steps:
                        <ol>
                            <li>In the Windows search bar, type Settings to open your Windows Settings.</li> 
                            <li>Search for Edit environment variables for your account.</li>
                            <img src="env_search.png" alt="VS Code Graph">
                            <li>In your User variables, select the Path variable and then select Edit.</li>
                            <li>Select New and add the MinGW-w64 destination folder you recorded during the installation process to the list. If you used the default settings above, then this will be the path: C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin.</li>
                            <li>Select OK, and then select OK again in the Environment Variables window to update the PATH environment variable. You have to reopen any console windows for the updated PATH environment variable to be available.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Check that your compiler has installed:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Close the terminal you have open in VS Code.</li>
                            <li>Close out of VS Code.</li>
                            <li>
                                Relaunch VS Code and open a new terminal and type:
                                <pre><code>gcc --version
g++ --version
gdb --version</code></pre>
                            </li>
                        </ol> 
                        You should see output that states which versions of GCC, g++ and GDB you have installed.
                    </li>

                <h3>Creating a Development Folder</h3>
                <h4>Purpose</h4>
                <p>
                    Creating a specific folder on your computer for coding projects will 
                    make it easier for you to remember where your coding projects are 
                    stored. Rather than having your projects scattered around multiple 
                    directories, everything that you might open in VS Code is in one 
                    place. This is not a necessary step, and you may skip this step if 
                    you already have a place on your computer where you store your code.
                </p>
                <h4>Instructions</h4>
                <p>
                    Create a folder called 'DEV' or 'Development' somewhere easy to 
                    access on your computer. We recommend nestling it in the same 
                    folder that your machine automatically creates the 'documents' and 
                    'downloads' folders since the development folder would be of 
                    similar relevance and it will be easy for you to find later.
                </p>
                <h3>Using Project Dashboard Extension</h3>
                <h4>Purpose</h4>
                <p>
                    VS Code Project Dashboard is a Visual Studio Code extension that 
                    lets you organize your projects using a graphical user interface 
                    built into VS Code. Projects are separated into groups and can be 
                    assigned a color.
                </p>
                <img src="project_dashboard_ss.png" alt="VS Code Graph">
                <p>
                    For new users who may forget where their files are stored or are 
                    unsure if they connected a project to a GitHub, the project 
                    dashboard extension provides a visual reminder. The different 
                    colors for different projects, collapsible folders, and the git 
                    icon that is displayed when you have connected a project to a 
                    GitHub repository are all intuitive and easy for new users to

                <p>
                    After installing Visual Studio Code and a compatible C++ Compiler, 
                    the next step is to install a C++ Extension within Visual Studio

                <p>
                    To begin coding in C++, first, you will need to create a new folder for 
                    your C++ project. You can do this by following the steps below: navigating to where you want this folder
                    in your file explorer, creating the folder (for example simple_c++_program), 
                    and then opening this folder in Visual Studio Code. 
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>From your file explorer, navigate to where you want your project folder to be,</li>
                    <li>Create a folder (for example simple_c++_program)</li>
                    <li> 
                        Open the folder in VS Code: 
                        <ol>
                            <li> In VS Code navigate to the file tab on the top banner.</li>
                            <li> 
                                From the file tab click Open Folder. this will open a 
                                file explorer window where you can navigate to the folder you just created.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p> 
                    Now that you are in your project folder you can create a C++ file 
                    and start coding! To create your C++ file:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Find the new file button</li>
                        <img src="Create New file in the folder button.png" alt="VS Code Graph">
                        <li>
                            Click on the 'new file' button and name the file. Be sure to add 
                            '.cpp' to the name to ensure that it is a C++ file.
                        </li>
                    </ol> 
                </p>
                <p>After it should look something like this:</p>
                <img src="Named file.png" alt="VS Code Graph">
                <p>
                    Once you set up your file, you are free to begin coding! 
                    Here is a sample of code to test that the compiler works.
                </p>
    <pre><code>#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
        
    int main()
    {
        int a, b, c;
        
        cout << "Enter an integer a: ";
        cin >> a;
    
        cout << "Enter an integer to multiply with a: ";
        cin >> b;
        //this should print 11*b
        cout << "a * b is: " << a*b << endl;
    
        cout << "Enter another integer: ";
        cin >> c;
        //this should print b*c + 11
        cout <<  "b * c + a is: " << b*c + a << endl;
    
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Next, to run the code to test it:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Click on the small triangle in the top right corner and open the drop down. </li>
                        <li>Select “Run C/C++ File”</li>
                        <img src="Running the code .png" alt="VS Code Graph">
                    </ol>  
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the bottom of the Terminal will output the first cout line and 
                    prompt the user to enter an integer.
                </p>
                <img src="First prompt.png" alt="VS Code Graph">
                <p>
                    Enter an integer and follow the chain until the program concludes.
                </p>
                <img src="Finished Prompts.png" alt="VS Code Graph">
                <p>
                    From here, you can modify this C++ file as you please, or you can create a new project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To reset or stop the current instance of the program, 
                    click the respective symbol at the top of the screen.
                </p>
