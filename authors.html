                This page was created by Savannah Stephenson and Sara Bowels.
                This topic is aimed at undergraduate students whose first language 
                is C++. By introducing them to a professional integrated development 
                environment that is used widely throughout the industry, these 
                undergraduate students can continue to master the program. Visual 
                Studio supports many of the most common programming languages, so 
                it may be easier for students to learn one program that encompasses 
                the languages they may use throughout their time as an undergraduate 
                versus many programs.

                Rather than having a static document SSB is hosting their technical 
                tutorial on github pages, which will allow the tutorial to be 
                dynamically updated if needed, and to reach a wider audience since 
                the page can come up through google search results. A site will be 
                easy for students to share amongst their peers and keep handy for 
                routine use.
